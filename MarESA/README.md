# Introduction

This script allows the user to aggregate resilience/resistance/sensitivity data across
varying tiers of EUNIS hierarchies.
The main purpose of this code is to develop a mechanism through
which the user can identify which completed
assessments sit within which tiers of the EUNIS hierarchy.
The outputs of these analyses should enable the user to
map the spatial distribution of assessments made at EUNIS
Levels 5 and 6 at less detailed resolutions
(e.g. EUNIS Level 2 and / or EUNIS Level 3).

For an overview of the aggregation process, please see the
